            <p>Weirdly enough, the hardest part of this project for me was the story.  I was deciding between either a &quot;castle getting attacked" story or a zombie story of some sort.  Either one, I didn’t know how to create a path to where 8 endings would result.  Eventually, I looked online for story ideas and saw somewhere the words &quot;Zombie Farm”.  For some reason, this jump-started my brain and immediately thought of a story.  Next was creating the objects for which each &quot;stage” of the story would take place.  Here, I would include properties such as backstory, question, choice1, and choice2.  This was pretty easy as it was just putting text from my Google doc into my HTML page.  The next hardest part came from creating functions that would take you across the story.  Figuring out how I wanted to link one stage of a story to another took a while.  Eventually, I decided to make a function to start the game, which would be used at the end to restart the story.  I also decided on making functions for each stage of the story, so if you choose an option that leads you to Stage 5 for example, pressing that option button would call forth the function for Stage 5, which then resets the story, options, etc.  I used a layout similar to the Holy Grail Layout and turned the screen to a dark purple with light gray text which I think turned out quite nice.  Other than that, I didn’t have any major difficulties.  The rest of the assignment came down to fixing small errors that came along the way.</p>
