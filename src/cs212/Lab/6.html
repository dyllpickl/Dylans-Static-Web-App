            <p>This was one of the more difficult labs as many of the problems occurred when I was trying to figure out the function and its relation between my HTML file and Javascript file.  First off, I ended up deciding to create a website that would calculate the product of two numbers that the user chooses.  I started by writing the HTML file, then went to the CSS file where I would create the Holy Grail layout.  After looking back through some notes, I was able to finish that part.  The most difficult part came last when I finally started working on the Javascript.  I was able to get the input boxes to work but wasn&apos;t able to figure out how to get the “Go&quot; button to activate my product() function.  After much time, ended up creating a function that would take the two inputs, multiply them, and change a section of my page to update it with the product of the two values.  It turns out that apart from some fine tweaking, the biggest problem was that the “getElementById()&quot; was actually “getElementbyId()&quot; which I didn&apos;t realize until the end...</p>
