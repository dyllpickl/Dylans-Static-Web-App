            To start, I looked online to find free fonts which I could use for this lab.  After looking at the site <a href="https://www.dafont.com">dafont.com</a>, I found a font called &quotINFECTED&quot which I liked.  From there, I downloaded the zip file which I would then move into my GitHub static web app.</p>
        <p>
            Now in my web app, I entered the homework folder where I would then make another folder titled &quotcss&quot where a &quotstyles.css&quot file would be.  Within the &quotcss&quot folder, I placed the &quotINFECTED&quot font file so that my &quotstyles.css&quot file could refer to it using &quot@font-face&quot.  Within the &quotstyles.css&quot file, I used &quot@font-face&quot to refer to the &quotINFECTED&quot file, and used a rule to make all text within the body to have the &quotINFECTED&quot font.  To make it easier to see, I also made all text have a font-size of 40px.</p>
