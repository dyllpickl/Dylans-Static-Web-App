            To start, I looked online to find free fonts which I could use for this lab.  After looking at the site <a href="https://www.dafont.com" target="_blank">dafont.com</a>, I found a font called &quot;Dripping Marker&quot; which I liked.  From there, I downloaded the zip file which I would then move into my GitHub static web app.</p>
        <p>
            Now in my web app, I entered the homework folder where I would then make another folder titled &quot;css&quot; where a &quot;styles.css&quot; file would be.  Within the &quot;css&quot; folder, I placed the &quot;Dripping Marker&quot; font file so that my &quot;styles.css&quot; file could refer to it using &quot;@font-face&quot;.  Within the &quot;styles.css&quot; file, I used &quot;@font-face&quot; to refer to the &quot;Dripping Marker&quot; file, and used a rule to make all text within the body to have the &quot;Dripping Marker&quot; font.  To make it easier to see, I also made all text have a font-size of 40px.</p>
