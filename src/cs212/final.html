      <h1>Addendum</h1>
      <p>For any project like this one, the easiest way to complete it is piece by piece.  First, I worked on the basic layout of my page.  Where different sections of my page would be, the styling choices for the page, the size of the table, and just getting the table up to begin with. This part was the easiest by far as at this point, no human interaction was needed for the site to function properly.  After completing that, I worked on making each box interactable, and when clicked on, would toggle the color.  While I was initially trying to do some complicated coding on the JavaScript page, I ultimately figured out that it would be best to change the class of the box from white to grey and vice versa.  Then in my CSS styling page, I could say what the background color would be when the class is white versus grey.  After I was able to toggle the color of each box by clicking it, next came creating the &quot;You win!&quot; pop-up.  While it wasn&apos;t difficult, I did take a little bit to figure out how to do it.  Ultimately, I created a function that would loop through each table data element and look at the class.  If a single element with the class &quot;white&quot; were to be found, then the loop would be broken, and a variable would return false, essentially saying that all squares are not grey.  If not a single class of &quot;white&quot; was found, then that same variable would return true.  This function would then be used in an if statement, where if the function returned true, display &quot;You won!&quot;, otherwise pass.  I purposefully did this now because, after that, I would be working on toggling the adjacent squares as well, which would cause many problems.  The problem I had was trying to figure out how to tell the computer, &quot;toggle the square to the north, east, south, and west&quot; because a computer doesn&apos;t know a sense of direction.  To fix this, I used .index() to create two variables, one for an index of rows and another for columns.  Then by adding/subtracting 1 from the value of rows or columns, I could get the desired square I wanted.  This would then allow me to call a new function for each square, 5 in total.  The new function would check if the square fits inside the parameters of the table, and if so, would toggle the color.  If not, then just simply pass.  At this point, the game itself was fully done!  When you click a square, itself and its adjacent ones would toggle.  After all squares were turned grey, then a window alert would appear saying &quot;You win!&quot;  However, to make it easier for testing, the game always started as fully white since I left the randomizer for last.  After some research, I found that I could use &quot;Math.random()&quot; to help with my problem.  Since &quot;Math.random()&quot; only gives values between 0 and 1, I would use a simple if statement: If the value is under 0.5, make the class white, else make it grey.  This would then successfully randomize the board each time you refresh.</p>
